# SMS-CLASSIFIER
SMS Classifier Data Science Project using Python

1.INTRODUCTION :
The project aims to develop a robust SMS classifier using data science techniques and Python programming. With the increasing volume of SMS messages, automating the process of classifying messages as spam or ham (non-spam) becomes crucial for effective communication. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to achieve accurate and efficient SMS classification.

2. Objectives:

Develop a dataset of labeled SMS messages for training and testing.

Implement preprocessing techniques to clean and transform raw text data.

Explore and analyze different machine learning algorithms for text classification.

3.Methodology :
Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of SMS messages, labeled as spam or ham.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization and stemming.

Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

Model Selection: Experiment with various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest.

Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset.


4. Implementation:

The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn, NLTK, and Flask for creating a web interface.

The code is structured into modules for data preprocessing, model training, and user interface development.


5. Results:

B.Confusion matrix and other relevant metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham messages.


6. Discussion:

Analyze the strengths and limitations of the implemented SMS classifier.

Discuss potential improvements and future enhancements.


7.Conclusion:

IN Conclusion,This project aimed to build a SMS spam classifier that can automatically distinguish between spam and ham messages. The project used various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF, to preprocess and transform the text data. The project also applied and compared four machine learning algorithms, namely Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to train and evaluate the classifier. The project used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as the performance metrics.
The results showed that the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance among the four models, with an accuracy of 0.98 and an F1-score of 0.97 on the test data. The Random Forest Classifier also demonstrated consistent results on both the training and test data, indicating that it did not suffer from overfitting or underfitting. The results also showed that the classifier could handle different types of messages, such as short or long, formal or informal, and English or non-English.
This project demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms in solving text classification problems. The project also provided a useful and practical tool that can help users filter and organize their SMS messages. The project can be further improved by using more data from different sources and languages, exploring more advanced techniques and methods, such as deep learning or word embeddings, and deploying the classifier as a web or mobile app.# bharat-intern-project
